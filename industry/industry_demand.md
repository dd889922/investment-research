# Coal Industry Demand Analysis

## 1. Main Demand Sources

Coal demand in China mainly comes from:

- Power generation (largest share)
- Steel industry
- Chemical industry

Among these, power generation is the dominant and most stable demand source.

## 2. Why Power Demand Is Stable

Electricity demand is non-discretionary and cannot be interrupted.

Although renewable energy capacity has expanded rapidly, wind and solar power
are inherently intermittent, requiring stable base-load energy sources.

Coal-fired power remains the most reliable base-load option in China.

## 3. Implications for Coal Industry

This means coal demand in China is not driven by growth narratives,
but by system-level energy security.

For leading coal companies, this creates a relatively stable demand floor.
